{"name":"Austria flood","tagline":"A tilemill project to visualize open flood data in Austria","body":"# Intro\r\n\r\nThis is mainly a playground to explore different ways on how to represent areal, open data that we\r\ncurrently can get on floodings in Austria. At the time of developing this prototype (August 2013), very little open flood data is available.\r\nUpper Austria is the only one of nine states, that has published shape files as open data so far:\r\n\r\nhttp://data.gv.at/suche/?search-term=hochwasser&formatTopFilter_shp=on&formatFilter_shp=on&connection=and#showresults\r\n\r\n\r\n# About\r\n\r\nBy using TileMill, the available shape files on flooding are visualized on a map. Several iterations have been created:\r\n\r\n## Austria Flood 1.0 Minimalistic\r\n\r\nVisualizes all rivers in austria + the available flooding data of Upper Austria.\r\n\r\n<iframe width='500' height='300' frameBorder='0' src='http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/dasjo.austria_flood.html'></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Austria Flood 2.0 OSM Bright\r\n\r\nAdds cities, woods, roads and other information based on the [OSM Bright](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright) preset.\r\n\r\nThe color scheme of OSM Bright has been lightened to focus on the flood data.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the visualization of flood data has been tuned. Flood risk zones (Hochwasser Risikozonen) are colored\r\naccording to their definition in blue (Blaue Zone), yellow (Gelbe Zone), orange (GelbRote Zone) and red (Rote Zone).\r\nFlooding areas (Hochwasserüberflutungsflächen) are restricted to those of a prediction for 30 years (HW30) and tooltips\r\nare provided for those.\r\n\r\n<iframe width='500' height='300' frameBorder='0' src='http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/dasjo.austria_flood2.html'></iframe>\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\nThe provided source code can be used to replicate the setup for the above examples. Feel free to play around and fork!\r\n\r\n* Install TileMill: http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/\r\n* Add Austria OSM using Postgis\r\n  * Follow steps 1 + 2 from http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/\r\n  * For step 2 use http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/austria-latest.osm.pbf\r\n* git clone https://github.com/dasjo/austria_flood.git ~/Documents/MapBox/projects/austria_flood\r\n\r\nThe flood-related shape files are open data published as follows:\r\nhttp://data.gv.at/suche/?search-term=hochwasser&formatTopFilter_shp=on&formatFilter_shp=on&connection=and#showresults\r\n\r\n\r\n# Open issues\r\n\r\nThe projection of the flood shape files isn't matched exactly. This needs be fixed, because the overlays seems to be off about 30m at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Further reading\r\n\r\n* [New York 100-Year Flood Zones](http://project.wnyc.org/100yr-flood-ny)\r\n* [Anke Domscheit-Berg: Flutopfer sollen steuerfinanzierte Hochwasserkarten von Behörden kaufen?
